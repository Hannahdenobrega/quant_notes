    "text": "Martingale’s\nFinance probability theory: a martingale is a stochastic process that represents the expected value of the future payoff, ceteris paribus, and is equal to the current value of the process. i.e. a martingale represents a process in which there is no inherent bias or predictability in the future outcomes.\nA discrete-time process \\(X_t\\) is a martingale if, for all t, it satisfies the property:\n\\[\nE[X_{t+1}|X_1, X_1,...,X_t] = X_t\n\\]\nThis property essentially says that the expected value of the next time step’s value, ceteris paribus, is equal to the current value.\n\n\nApplication to Option Pricing\nOption pricing is a crucial field in finance, and martingales play a fundamental role in its theoretical foundation. One of the most famous models that uses Martingales for option pricing is the Black-Sholes model. In the BS model, a financial derivative like a European call option can be priced using a risk-neutral valuation approach. This approach assumes that there is a risk-neutral probability measure under which the expected return on the underlying asset is the risk-free rate. This is where the Martingale concept features because, regardless of the future price movements of the underlying asset, the portfolio’s value will follow a fair-game pattern with no predictable bias; ensuring that there are no arbitrage opportunities, and the option can be priced consistently. As such we can construct a portfolio of underlying assets and options in such a way that its’ value evolves as a martingale.\n\n\nMathematical illustration\nConsider a European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock. The stock price follows the geometric Brownian motion:\n\\[\ndS = \\mu dt + \\sigma S dW\n\\]\nwhere:\n\\(S\\) = stock price\n\\(\\mu\\) = drift (expected return) of the stock\n\\(\\sigma\\) = volatility of the stock\n\\(dW\\)= Wiener process (Brownian motion)\nThe option price C can be derived as a combination of the risk-free bond and the underlying stock, such that the portfolio follows a martingale process. This leads to the BS formula:\n\\[\nc = SN(d1) - Ke - rTN(d2) \\\\\n\\]\n\\[\nC = Se^{-q^t}N(d_1) - Ke^{-r^t}N(d_2)\\\\\n\\]\n\\[\nP = Ke^{-r^t}N(-d_2)- Se^{-q^t}N(-d_1)\n\\]\nWhere:\n\\(K\\) = strike price of the option\n\\(r\\) = risk-free rate\n\\(T\\) = time to expiration\nwith a standard normal cumulative distribution function\nThis formula demonstrates the use of Martingale in option pricing, as it ensures the option price is consistent with a fair game where there are no predictable biases in future outcomes.\n\n\nSummary\nMartingales are a powerful concept in finance that ensures fair pricing and the absence of arbitrage opportunities. In option pricing, Martingales are used to create risk-neutral portfolios that follow unbiased, fair-game patterns, leading to the development of models like the BS model for pricing derivatives."

    "text": "Faithful models of financial time series are notoriously hard to construct. They must account for a series of “stylized facts” that are highly relevant for risk control and option pricing: fat tails, long memory volatility fluctuations, asymmetries both in returns (past negative returns increase future vol) and in time (past trends, of arbitrary sign, increase vol), etc.\nSimple models fail to capture these effects and, correspondingly, generate poor volatility surfaces. The recent Path Dependent Volatility (PDV) model of\nJulien Guyon\noffers an interesting compromise, with a relatively low number of factors, but still fails at capturing, e.g., the term structure of the kurtosis of returns.\nAnother path is to use wavelets, and the so-called “scattering spectra” which are multi-time scales generalization of mixed moments, that compress the information contained in a time series of length T into (log_2 T)**3 parameters by exploiting the scale invariance properties of price processes (but also of turbulent flows, natural images or fracture surfaces). Yet another possibility would be to use generative AI, in a more black-box and less transparent approach.\nIn any case, once one has devised a good enough generative model of prices, how can it be used to predict, say, future realized volatility and option smiles? The “Path Shadowing Monte-Carlo” method that we developed with\nRudy Morel and Stéphane Mallat offers an intuitive and practical answer, illustrated by the figure below:\n·      Generate a very long synthetic series of price returns\n·      Scan this fictitious long time series in order to find snippets that match (“shadow”) as well as possibly the actual past price series (as seen from today)\n·      Weight these snippets with a decreasing function of the distance between the actual past price path and the synthetic price paths\n·      Use the future returns of these snippets to generate weighted realistic scenarios for actual returns\n·      Compute any observable of interest using a Monte-Carlo method with these weighted paths as inputs\n·      For option pricing, add an appropriate hedging strategy in the computation, as in the “Hedged Monte-Carlo” method that we proposed long ago with\nMarc Potters\n(see Potters, M., Bouchaud, J. P., & Sestovic, D. (2001). Hedged Monte-Carlo: low variance derivative pricing with objective probabilities. Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 289(3-4), 517-525.)\nThe results, as applied to the S&P 500, are quite cool – for full details, see the paper above, that I am really happy with. In particular, we find that our Scattering Spectra model outperforms the current version of the PDV model for realized volatility predictions beyond 7 days and for the term structure of the smile curvature."
