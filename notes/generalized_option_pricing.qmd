## A general formula for option pricing

The Black-Scholes formula for option pricing is derived by asserting assumptions related to geometric Brownian motion dynamics, which do not correspond to how assets behave in reality. 

Firstly, is there a general option pricing formula that is generalized enough to relax the assumptions such that the dynamics of the underlying assets follow under any type of dynamic?

Secondly, will it have certain similarities with the Black-Scholes formula?

Under the absence of arbitrage, it is possible to obtain a completely general formula that gives the price, $C_{t,T,K}$, of a call option with the stochastic risk-free rate ($r_s$) and for any possible dynamics for the underlying asset (Geman et al. 1995, Klenbaner 2005, and Bjork 2019):


\begin{aligned}
C(t,T,K) &= S_t \mathbb{Q}_S [S_T > K | \digamma_t] - KP(t,T)\mathbb{Q}_T[S_T > K | \digamma_t] \\

\frac{d \digamma{Q}_T}{d \digamma{Q}} &= \frac{S_T}{S_0 e^{\int_{0}^{T}r_s d_S}} \\

\frac{d \digamma{Q}_T}{d \digamma{Q}} &= \frac{1}{P(0,T) e^{\int_{0}^{T}r_s d_S}} 
\end{aligned}


### Similarities to Black-Scholes

- the price of a call option will always be the difference of two terms
    - the first contains the product of the current price of the underlying ($S_t$) by the conditional probability under a certain measure of probability ($\mathbb{Q}_S$) that the option ends in the money
    - the second shows the product of the strike price ($K$) by the current price of a zero coupon bond with the same maturity as the option, $P(t,T)$, and by the conditional probability, under another measure $\mathbb{Q}_T$, that the option ends in the money.

All these terms appear in the Black-Scholes formula, and the only difference lies in the concrete expression of the probabilities.

### Differences from Black-Scholes

- the only difference lies in the concrete expression of the probabilities
- The probability measure $\mathbb{Q}_S$ has the underlying numeraire
- $\mathbb{Q}_T$ is the T-forward measure, which has a zero coupon bond with maturity T as numeraire
- both measures are determined by their Radon-Nikodym derivatives that appear under the expression of the call price

## Conclusion

Thus, if one has a stochastic model for the dynamics of any underlying asset, one only has to be able to calculate the previous probabilities to obtain the price of a call option written on that underlying asset.
